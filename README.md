### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
Hi. I'm studing various area, what I interested in.
currently, I learning in Github's manual, data processing(image processing, CNN, etc)  and raspberry Pi(just Little),
but I also interested in 3D modeling(Blender).
so, just learning in various subject, and just only make small python project,
but I hope to make help in other's project.
have a nice day!

- I Learning of...
   (in this case, I only study using lecture. actually, I have just only one project which I struct and make code.
    so, just note what I learned, I'm not have practical experience yet.)
   1. python: Simulation(project which use DF/iteration), image processing, CNN
   2. blender: basic rigging, texturing, and rendering video -> (my github's profile image is make in blender)
   3. and basic C and java, both language are learned, but I haven't used for a long time.

- I want to make...
  1. 3d animation in blender. rigging and texturing is hard to learned, but I want to make my complete video.
  2. data analyis. actually, I think find a specific subject's data and analysis is not easy...
                   but I hope, and interested in this subject. so if I have a chance, I analysis, and show the result.
  3. deep Learning. In my level, I just learn of various of this case, but when I got used to it, I start the project from design~and make it.
